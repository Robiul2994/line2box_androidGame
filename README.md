**RULES**  
The game starts with an empty grid of dots. The grid can be any size and Gametable's Dots and Boxes has a handful to choose from.  
  
Players take turns connecting 2 unjoined horizontally or vertically adjacent dots. A player who completes the fourth side of a 1x1 box earns one point and must take another turn.  
  
The game ends when all lines are drawn and boxes are claimed. The player with the most points wins. The game is a tie if more than one player has the same high score. 

**STRATEGY**  
Most novice players always claim a box if they can, but expert players take time to consider double-crossing their opponent. A double cross is when you give your opponent a short chain of boxes and then leave them with no choice but to create a long chain for you on the next turn. It is the key to winning!  
  
**HISTORY**  
Dots and Boxes have classically been played on paper using pencils. It was first described by a French mathematician, Ã‰douard Lucas, in the 19th century. Mr Lucas called it La Pipopipette.
